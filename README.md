_“Hey bebeto, when we first met, I fell in love with you. Nothing in this cute wild wide world prepared me for the fresh breath of sunflowers 🌻 you bring to my life…”_

Bebeto was the first website I ever developed with SuperHi Coding Editor. I came across SuperHi’s free course, [Plan, Design + Code Your First Website]([url](https://www.superhi.com/catalog/plan-design-and-code-your-first-website)), and then I saw the body of beautiful student work they were showcasing and I thought ooh la la! I need to try this.
